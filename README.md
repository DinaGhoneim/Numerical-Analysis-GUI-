# Numerical-Analysis-GUI-

# Description
This project is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application designed to perform various numerical analysis computations. It provides an intuitive interface for users to input data and parameters, and it computes results for different numerical methods.

# Features
User-friendly interface for numerical analysis.
Supports a variety of numerical methods including:
Root finding (e.g., Newton-Raphson method)
Numerical integration (e.g., Trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule)
Numerical differentiation
Solving systems of linear equations
Visualization of results through plots and charts.
Save and load analysis sessions.

# Installation
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:

sh
نسخ الكود
git clone https://github.com/your-username/numerical-analysis-gui.git
cd numerical-analysis-gui
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

sh
نسخ الكود
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

sh
نسخ الكود
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

sh
نسخ الكود
python main.py

# Usage
Launch the application by running python main.py.
Use the GUI to select the numerical method you want to use.
Input the necessary data and parameters.
Click the "Compute" button to see the results.
Use the provided options to visualize, save, or export the results.

# Example
To perform a root-finding calculation using the Newton-Raphson method:

Select "Root Finding" from the main menu.
Enter the function and its derivative.
Provide the initial guess and tolerance.
Click "Compute" to see the root and the iterative process.
